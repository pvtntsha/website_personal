<h3>AbOuT mYsElF</h3>
<p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Intan Natasya Binti Abd Razak. I was born on March 25, 2004, at Kajang Hospital, Selangor. My parents gave me my name, which means "precious" or "gem" to them. Additionally, my family often calls me by my nicknames, Tasha or Kak Sha, as I am the second youngest of eight siblings.</p>

<h4>AgE aNd ChAlLeNgEs</h4>
<p>I turned 20 years old this year. At this age, I find it quite challenging because I need to be independent and learn to do things on my own, especially now that I am in a new place. Moving far away from Melaka to Kedah has given me different experiences and tested my ability to adapt. Even though I am far from my family, I am grateful for being able to adjust well and face these new challenges. This experience has taught me the true meaning of independence and resilience.</p>

<h5>HoBbiEs</h5>
<p>One of my hobbies is reading, especially novels about love and stories that evoke deep emotions and sadness. Each page takes me into a world full of feelings, making me forget the reality for a while. For me, reading is a way to escape and experience emotions that I don't always get to feel in real life.</p>

<h6>AmBiTiOnS</h6>
<p>I once dreamed of becoming a chef. I imagined myself in the kitchen, creating delicious dishes and bringing joy to others through food. However, that dream was shattered when I was rejected from the culinary program that I applied to. Since then, I have felt as though the path I chose has become unclear, and I am still searching for direction in my life. For now, I don't have a specific ambition, but I believe that every experience is a step toward discovering who I truly am.</p>
